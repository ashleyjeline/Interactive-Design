			<h1>THE GOOD, THE BAD, THE UGLY!</h1>
		
			<p>Examples of successful interactive design, and some that are just horrible</p>
		
				<h2>THE GOOD</h2>
			
				<p>Rifle Paper Company<p>

					<p>Beautiful layout, visually appealing and easy to navigate. Branding is on point, as well as all typefaces flowing together smoothly throughout the page. It has visual strength and branding strength. 
					The viewer definitely knows what they are looking at and who they are looking at. A good representation of the company and their voice. One weakness could be the page doesn't reformat when the window gets smaller. 
					Color palette is very well done throughout the page and the links. Possibly one thing that viewers might have an issue with is the brand typeface for the site. Has a cast shadow that for some can be difficult to read. 
					Strength is definitely visual.</p>

					<p>Very easy to navigate and functions like the website.
		 			Visual branding is recognizable and it something that makes the application easy to recognize. 
		 			Mostly straightforward and simple (just like the website).
					One things that could possible improve is the fact that on the phone it can sometimes randomly link to things and open up another page, making it difficult for the viewer. 
					People want to visit the app because it makes "pinning" things simple when you're on the go. Strengths are branding and accessibility.
		 			The design and functionality is what makes this app so strong.</p>

		 <h2>THE BAD</h2>
		 
		 <p>Cornish/Compass Website</p>

		 		<p>To much information and to much text all at once. It can get confusing to navigate and can redirect the user to information not needed or loading doesn't seem to work very well
		  		and can reload things already submitted. Not visually appealing, and the navigation can get confusing because of the spacing between text. Can be difficult to follow everything written
		   		and words/paragraphs can blend into others. 
				Layout is jumbled, doesn't really have any sort of identity or branding for the facility its representing. Links can become lost in between other text, and the color pallet is very dull.</p>

			<h2>THE DOWNRIGHT UGLY</h2>
			
				<p>The Church of Scientology</P>
			
					<p><img src="http://www.dw.de/image/0,,617653_4,00.gif"></p>
			
					<p>There are so many typefaces, links, videos streaming and bad icons. The "branding" is muted by all of the information on the page. 
					People can visit the webpage but can become lost in the sea of information and links to further information.
			 		Overly complicated in terms of navigation. Not visually appealing and seems to focus more on the informational aspect. 
			 		It could improve on many things. A color pallet that is diverse and visually appealing. Since most users navigate towards websites that can have them interact but don't feel overwhelming, 
			 		this webpage could be more simplistic in design. 
			 		People visit this site to be informed but inspired and it seems to navigate to strongly towards a formal side, and could be read as somewhat intimidating.</p>
