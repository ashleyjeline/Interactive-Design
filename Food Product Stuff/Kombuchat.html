		<h1>Kombucha</h1> 

	
(pronounced Kom-Boo-Chaa), often called mushroom tea, is a
 fermented beverage made from black or green tea, sugar and a fungus culture.
  It has been used as a health tonic for centuries in China, Japan and Russia.

		<h2>How We Make It</h2>


The fermentation process yields a tart, tangy and effervescent (fizzy)
 sort of cidery-tasting beverage that is ultra-low in calories, high
  in nutrients (in particular, a broad spectrum of B vitamins), rich
   in antioxidants (including polyphenols), enzymes, amino acids and
    loads of probiotics. And, because the fermentation converts most 
    of the sugar into organic acids, 
the resulting drink has as few as two grams of sugar per cup.
